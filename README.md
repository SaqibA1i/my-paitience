Improving your connection with your doctor and your health. All from the comfort of your own home.

## Description

Our application strives to enhance and improve patients' relationships with their doctors by connecting with them remotely. We target key pain points that users have addressed in our secondary research. Users outline that they have trouble booking appointments with their doctor. They address that they have trouble tracking their own prescriptions and medication. Lastly, they discuss that they have trouble understanding their diagnosis beyond the doctor's office. 

To remediate these pain points, we created these key features. The first feature is a booking appointment feature that allows the user to book appointments virtually with their doctor according to both schedules. The second feature is a prescription tracker that reminds users when to take their medications and shows the doctor's instructions for it. The last feature is a monitoring feature that shows the user's diagnosis over time. Using the data from monitoring and methods of machine learning, we also create an essential risk assessment that suggests areas where the users may be at risk and should contact their doctor.
